# 🚲 Bike Sales Analysis (Python)

## Business Question
**What factors generate the most profit in bike sales?**

---

## Project Overview
This project analyzes **bike sales transaction data** using Python to identify the key drivers of profitability across time, geography, customer demographics, and products.

The objective is to move beyond descriptive statistics and answer a clear business question using data-driven analysis.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains **transaction-level bike sales data**, including:
- Customer demographics (age, gender)
- Geographic information (country, state)
- Product details (category, sub-category, product)
- Pricing and quantity information

> Note: The dataset was intentionally modified to remove pre-calculated financial metrics.  
> Revenue, cost, and profit were calculated manually to demonstrate data transformation and analytical reasoning.
